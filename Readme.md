 A webbased social media platform for sharing photos

## Introduction

 The goal of this project is to build a web application a little more complex than the previous ones with a little less means.

## Objectives

This web project is challenging you to create an interactive photo sharing platform.

## Mandatory

Your website should have a decent page layout (meaning at least a header, a main section and a footer), be able to display correctly on mobile devices and have an adapted layout on small resolutions.
All your forms should have correct validations and the whole site should be secured.
This point is MANDATORY and shall be verified when your application would be evaluated. To have an idea, here are some stuff that is NOT considered as SECURE:

- Store plain or unencrypted passwords in the database.
- Offer the ability to inject HTML or “user” JavaScript in badly protected variables.
- Offer the ability to upload unwanted content on the server.
- Offer the possibility of altering an SQL query.
- Use an extern form to manipulate so-called private data

The application should allow a user to sign up by asking at least a valid email
address, an username and a password with at least a minimum level of complexity.

- At the end of the registration process, an user should confirm his account via a
unique link sent at the email address fullfiled in the registration form.
- The user should then be able to connect to your application, using his username
and his password. He also should be able to tell the application to send a password
reinitialisation mail, if he forget his password.
- The user should be able to disconnect in one click at any time on any page.
- Once connected, an user should modify his username, mail address or password.
